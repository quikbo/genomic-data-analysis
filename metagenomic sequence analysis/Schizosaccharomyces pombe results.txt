S. pombe analysis:
    mapped reads - 4662367

    spliced alignments - 162989

S. pombe realignment analysis:

    spliced alignments - 27985

The sliced alignment parameter --min-intronlen was set to 200, 
which has a default value of 20. Increasing the minimum intron
length by a factor of 10 made a big difference in the analysis, 
around 100,000 less reads mapped and about 140,000 less spliced
alignments. This happened because setting this parameter to 200
made hisat ignore any introns shorter than 200, which is clearly
the majority of them if there is such a big difference in the 
spliced alignments.
