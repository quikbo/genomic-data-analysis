Unix command to obtain number of spliced alignments for each sample:

samtools view a479052.bam | awk 'BEGIN {count=0} $6 ~ /N/ {count++} END {print count}'


- samtools view omits header of bam file
- BEGIN command initializes count to 0
- $6 ~ /N/ checks for 'N' in the 6th column, the CIGAR column, of every line
- END command prints the value of count after awk processes every line in the bam file

Changed the line with the bam file name to find the spliced 
alignments for each of the 11 samples.
